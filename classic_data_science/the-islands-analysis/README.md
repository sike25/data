# Drug-Testing
The summary, analysis and plotting of the results from a clinical trial carried out on the virtual population called "The Islands".

### Question and Hypothesis
To what extent do psilocybin mushrooms and vodka affect a person’s ability to pay attention? e expected psilocybin mushrooms and vodka to  decrease the attention of our participants. 

### Participation Criteria

We picked subjects from four villages that were all on the same island of Providence and were all coastal regions, to minimize diversity in the data that could be due to location. We also picked subjects that were 21 to 65 years old, because we took into account the legal age for drinking and the upper limit with which experimenters tend to pick subjects. We also could not consider subjects who were ill, pregnant or had an attention disorder. We took account of the subject’s gender and drinking habits; these were not factors for exclusion.
We had sixty subjects in total, twenty in each of three treatment groups.

### Attention Test (designed by the creator of The Islands)
Subjects are given a screen in which random letters pop up sporadically. Subjects are prefaced to only touch the letter “Z” in order to measure their attention rates. The better you pay attention to the screen, the less likely you are to miss any Z’s.

### Methods
1. Attention Test given prior to treatment
2. Treatment: 10g of psilocybin mushrooms or 2 shots of Vodka (30 ml each) or Sugar pill
3. Given twice in 30 minute increments post-treatment
There were three treatment groups: the psilocybin mushrooms, the vodka and the treatment pill. And they were all applied in to people from the different towns and of different genders in equal numbers.

### Results
Missed questions increase way more in the alcohol group than the mushroom group.

In the alcohol group, 50%  of the females missed about 25 questions whereas 50% of males missed far less than that, possibly 10 questions. Females in the alcohol group experienced a decrease in attention more than males. This makes sense because women tend to absorb higher concentrations of alcohol in the blood more than men because women generally have less body weight than men.

There seems to be no general trend between focus and age based on substance groups.

Arcadians were the least attentive in general. And Hayaranos were the most attentive. (Shinobi > Reading in the middle). Arcadia: High percentage of occupants in primary production occupations, like fishing, pig and apple farming, etc. Which is understandable because they are a bit isolated.
Hayarano and Shinobi had more of their population spread out into primary, secondary and tertiary production activities.

### Limitations
 We can only apply the data to modify life on the Islands, not in our world. We can not take advice from this experiment.
